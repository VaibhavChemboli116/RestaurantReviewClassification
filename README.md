# RestaurantReviewClassification
## 🍽️ Introduction

The Restaurant Review Classification project aims to determine whether customers are providing positive or negative reviews. This analysis helps in identifying areas for improvement, such as service quality or food standards, to enhance the restaurant's overall profitability and business success.

## 🤖 Algorithm Used: Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, commonly used for solving classification problems. It proves particularly effective in text classification scenarios with high-dimensional training datasets. The Naive Bayes Classifier is known for its simplicity and efficiency in building fast machine learning models that can make rapid predictions.

### Key Features:

- **Probabilistic Classifier:** Predicts based on the probability of an object.
